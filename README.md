The catalog of books in this corpus is given in 'data catalog.csv'. 

Textual data is from two open websites, http://www.xueheng.net and http://www.daizhige.org/. 

Here is a data sample for a single book: data_sample.txt


*******online platform*******

We show the corpus and results with data analysis functions on an online platform: http://evolution.pkudh.xyz/ 

The initial loading of each feature can be slow. To avoid repeated loading, it is recommended to use multiple browser windows for different functions.  

In text reuse reading, the platform will transmit the entire book at once. To avoid repeated transmission, it is advisable to open individual sentences in new windows for intertextual browsing.

It is now publicly accessible. Using Peking University VPN access can speed up the response.
